- **Docker Compose Deployment:** Simplifies deployment with Docker Compose configuration, enabling easy setup and service orchestration without complex commands.
- **Prometheus Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Prometheus to visualize real-time monitoring data.
- **Loki Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with Loki to visualize real-time logs.
- **Dashboard & Datasource Provisioning:** Comes with a prepared JSON dashboard and predefined data sources, automatically loaded using provisioning files.
- **Pre-configured Dashboards:** Comes with ready-to-use dashboards for Traefik, Docker, and Node Exporter, offering instant insights into system performance.
- **Email Alerts Support:** predefined email configuration to set alert rules.
- **Predefined Admin Credentials:** Allows the use of a predefined admin password stored in a `.env` file.

cd monitor-grafana
```

- Check `provisioning` directory for further dashboard and datasource configuration.

- Create `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file with credentails.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

- Create `mount` directory and change file permissions.

```
mkdir mount
chmod -R 775 ./mount

- Create `network-monitor` network if not exists.

```
docker network create network-monitor
```

- Run container.

```
docker stop                             monitor-grafana-c
docker rm                               monitor-grafana-c
docker compose -p monitor up --build -d grafana
docker compose -p monitor up -d         grafana
docker logs -f                          monitor-grafana-c
